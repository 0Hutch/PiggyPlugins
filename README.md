# RunelitePlugins

Automation plugins for Runelite. Fork of [PiggyPlugins](https://github.com/0Hutch/PiggyPlugins) which itself is a fork of EthanVann's EthanApiPlugins. üòÅ

Without their hard work this wouldn't be possible. Be sure to check out these projects as well.

**Plugins**:
- ChinBreakHandler (made by Owain - modified to work with runelite)*

# Instructions
Simply drag and drop `plugin-loader` into your `sideloaded-plugins` folder.

If you already have EthanApiPlugin on your runelite already, open loader config & disable the option to download EthanApi.

If you don't have a `sideloaded-plugins` folder, you'll want to grab `ethan-api-standalone` from EthanVann's repo and install the Runelite hijacker. You can reach out to me if you have any questions about this.
